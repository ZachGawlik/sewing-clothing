Hi! I've been sewing clothing for a year now.
Here are the things that surprised me about making my own clothes
even after extensively researching this hobby beforehand.

This page isn't intended to be a complete onboarding doc,
rather it's a companion that avoids repeating what you've already read elsewhere.
At the end, I provide a few practical next steps.

## You won't like sewing if laundry is your least-favorite chore

When you buy fabric, you have to wash and dry it before you use it.
If you bought multiple different colors, you must wash each color separately.
Fresh fabric bleeds a lot more than store-bought clothes!
You have to iron the whole yardage, likely fold it in half, then iron it carefully before you can begin cutting into it.
And you should iron after each and every seam you sew you.

It's not just during construction.
Over time you might find yourself making clothes with new-to-you types of fabric.
Some of which will have specific care instructions.
You'll actually follow those instructions for the handmade clothes you spent so much time on.
Sewing is a gateway to making your routine laundry a bit more complicated.

## You won't necessarily save money

Making your own garment will cost more than buying a similar item from H&M.
Fabric costs much more for consumers than it does for megacorps buying in bulk.
On the flip side, the fabric you sew with will be of higher quality and your garments will last longer.
And your money won't fund the fashion industry's abhorrent labor practices.

The costs start working in your favor if you compare to luxury stores, or if you make more eccentric pieces that only exist at bespoke shops.
But it will take time to work up your skill to attempt these more ambitious pieces.

Cost should not be your main motivator for learning how to sew your own clothes.
It will not pay off within your first year of sewing as you gain these skills.

## Creating clothes can feel like architecture or engineering

I'm very left-brained by nature, so I felt scared about taking on a hobby that I thought was purely creative.
Turns out, it can be quite rigorous!

Once you start significantly altering patterns, it takes methodical and mathematical effort to make it work.
You have to visualize the connection between 2D pieces of fabric to how they fit on a 3D person.
It's called pattern "drafting" for a reason.
At the industry level, pattern drafters use CAD software similar to what's used by architects and engineers.

This is something you can opt in to.
I find this work to be really engaging problem-solving, so I look for opportunities to do it.
If this idea scares you, you can more selectively find patterns that won't require much or any modification.

## There isn't much high-quality information online

I'm used to learning skills by searching for online resources and reading through tons of open tabs and bookmarks.
Compared to other skills, I don't think there are many good free online resources available.

There isn't nothing.
If you're sewing a popular pattern there might be a YouTube video of someone sewing it.
If you have a specific question you can find an article on it.
If you're having a fitting issue you'll come across a blog post of someone's personal case study.

But there aren't many definitive resources.
There's no sewing corollary to what justinguitar.com is for learning guitar.
There are a few YouTubers who churn out buzzwordy videos, but each video requires viewing a tangled web of their other videos to make it a coherent lesson.
But there is simply so much to learn before you even sew your first seam for your first garment!
I haven't seen any online resource walk you through that requisite background knowledge.

Your best bet is to go to your local library and check out one of either the
[Reader's Digest Complete Guide to Sewing](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/34226.Complete_Guide_to_Sewing) or
[Vogue Sewing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/791783.Vogue_Sewing).
They are the sewing bibles.

There is zero need to get both.
Each one is a complete resource that covers what tools you need, how to use your sewing machine, how to find suitable fabric, how to use a sewing pattern, and of course how to actually sew the garment together.
They've made many editions throughout the years, but just pick whatever is available.
They will set you up for success and save you time over trying to hodgepodge half-baked online articles.

## Let's go! What are the next steps?

Go to your library and check out one of the books I mentioned above in the previous heading.

If you want to ease in before creating something from scratch you can:

- fix holes in your existing clothes
- add a back patch pocket onto (sweat)pants that don't have one
- add a front patch pocket onto a shirt
- lengthen an existing pocket that is too short
- buy a cheap oversized thrift store button-up shirt and take in the waist and arms to better fit you

For your first project, find a basic pattern for a type of garment you already own.
This makes it much easier to buy the fabric, as you'll instinctively know what's right or wrong for it.
And when you get stumped, you can look inside the clothes you own to figure out how they come together.

If possible, I'd recommend getting your first pattern from a modern online-first pattern company.
They generally have very detailed instructions, and the pattern descriptions usually mention a skill level.
I can personally vouch for [Closet Core](https://closetcorepatterns.com/collections/sewing-patterns-all),
though I've heard [Helen's Closet](https://helensclosetpatterns.com/shop/) is particularly beginner-friendly.
Honestly "menswear" styles are lacking from all modern pattern companies.
If you can't find a modern company's pattern that interests you,
the 40+ year old companies (e.g. Butterick, McCall's, Simplicity, Burda)
have a much wider variety, but they have minimal instructions.
This is what I did, and I survived!

RegardlessÂ of what you choose, have fun with it!
And remember there's an "undo" button via your seam ripper.
